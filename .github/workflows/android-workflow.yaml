# This is a basic android workflow
# Now, we'll define the jobs we need in the current workflow.
# Runner's file system doesn't have the code yet! So, we need to check out
# the code from the current repository and set up the Java environment in the runner.

# Here we've used actions/checkout@v1 and actions/setup-java@v1 to checkout the current
# GitHub repository and setup Java Development Kit in runner respectively.
# The third step prints the contents of current working directory.
